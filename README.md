# Retail Sales Data Analytics Project (SQL)

## Project Description
In this project, I implemented a full cycle of data management for an e-commerce platform: from database schema design to writing complex analytical reports.

## Technologies
* **DB:** MySQL
* **Tools:** MySQL Workbench
* **SQL Skills:** DDL (table creation), DML (data populating), Joins (Inner, Left), Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG), Grouping (GROUP BY).

## Database Structure
A schema was designed for the project, including tables for customers, products, and orders with configured relationships (Foreign Keys).

## Key Reports
1. Revenue Analysis by City: Allowed us to identify the most profitable regions.
2. Product Performance: Identified top sellers by revenue.
3. Slow-Selling Product Analysis: Using LEFT JOIN, we identified products that had no sales, which is important for warehouse optimization.
